## Model-driven Generation of Microservice Architectures for Performance and Resilience Benchmarking

This approach was developed during the work on a Master's Thesis on performance anomaly detection microservice architectures [1].
It provides a model-driven approach to generate synthetic microservice architectures that can be used for evaluating performance  and resilience engineering approaches. Problem injection (e.g., delay) can also be injected.
